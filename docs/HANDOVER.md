## What this is
Static school website + staff/headmistress/pupil portals for **Treasure Academy, Ageva, Okene, Kogi State, Nigeria**.
Hosted on Vercel (preset "Other", no build command, output `./`, no env vars). Repo: github.com/treasureacademyageva/ng — work goes to the `preview` branch first; merge to `main` only when the owner says "go live". Never push straight to main.

## Current state (batch 50, `?v=20260919-50`, sw `treasure-v50`)
Batch 43 additions (owner-directed): "Treasure Sans" (Sora-based) + "Treasure Serif" (Fraunces-based) self-hosted in `assets/fonts/` — Google Fonts CDN removed from all 40 pages; a real studio-commissioned font can replace those files later with zero code change. Treasure FX layer at end of `site.js`: button ripple, segmented `.seg` tabs with sliding ink (graduates now toggle All/2025/2023), `[data-countup]` animated stat numbers, `.tilt` 3D-hover cards, `.stag-grid` staggered reveals, `.spy-bar` scroll-spy jump nav (alumni has one). Brand motif = `--motif` inline SVG diamond-seed in corporate.css (applied to section tags). Owner is bringing a brand designer's artwork later — drop files in and reference them; no AI/stock imagery permitted per owner.
- **40 pages**: 36 root + 4 portal (admin/teacher/pupil + login). Page-count pins in verify-batch9/10 = 40.
- **Accounts vs public display (IMPORTANT, owner demanded b42):**
  - `db.teachers` = the 7 DEMO login accounts (PIN 1234) — portal logins only.
  - `db.staffWall` = the REAL 10 staff from the school's filing (W01–W10: Idris Ibrahim … Bose Momoh, School Administrator). Display only — NO pins, NO logins. The alumni staff wall, collage, search, search engine, and staff popups read this.
  - `db.pupils` = demo pupils (kept).
  - `db.graduates` = the REAL 39 Common Entrance graduates seeded from Kogi Ministry papers: Class of 2025 (21, with exam numbers BS/OKN/141001–021 + ENG/MAT/GEP/total) and Class of 2023 (18). Display only.
  - Migrations in store.js move any legacy `class:"Graduated"` pupil rows into `graduates`.
  - `formerTeachers` seed empty — real former staff names come from the owner (chat), never invented.
- **Footer accreditation strip**: real marks fetched from official sources — Kogi Govt (kogistate.gov.ng), Kogi MoEST (moest.kogistate.gov.ng), NAPPS (nappsng.org), NYSC (nysc.gov.ng), CE crest (same ministry). They LINK to those official sites (owner decision) with target=_blank rel=noopener. CE note under strip: centre BS/OKN/141.
- **Staff Code of Conduct**: sidebar page in teacher (10th) + admin (above Settings, 22 sections total) portals; first-login must-accept modal (no decline), acceptance stored (`teacher.cocA/cocAt`, `school.cocA/cocAt`).
- **Code-managed identity**: school name/term/session/dates are NOT editable in admin UI (purged b39); owner dictates changes in chat → code.
- **Voting**: no vote buttons on the public wall (b42). Legacy `window.voteTeacher(id)` still records toward the headmistress' Teacher-of-Term tally (admin can crown).
- JS docs/best practice: all new public records → display arrays (staffWall/graduates), accounts stay minimal.

## Quality system
- 40 suites: `verify-batch2.js … verify-batch41.js` in workspace root (not in repo). FRESH total after every batch: run all, sum "passed". Latest: **1307 checks, 0 failures** (b42).
- Run from /home/user: `npm install jsdom --no-audit --no-fund` first each session.
- Version pins inside ~17 suites (b15, b26–b41): sed `treasure-vNN` + `20260919-NN` on every bump; sw.js `treasure-vNN`; developer.html `var BUILD`. README ×2 with fresh sum.
- Data-truth asserts retire whenever owner changes data (b8 T007 Nursery 1, b9 Aunty Rafatu votes, b14 sort order = Creche first/Bose last, b40/b41 wall semantics).

## Owner standing rules (short list)
Real data from owner only (never invent names/dates); WhatsApp 09063932487 only; no online assignment submission; birthdays staff+headmistress only; CBT only as Primary 6 CE practice; professional look, no pills nav, no hamburger (sidebars OK desktop); day+dark token colors; payments = bank transfer to school account; keep site simple — delete unneeded files; suggestions each round (owner approves/rejects each).

## Open items for next rounds
- Shaibu Memunat (11th name on staff filing) — no role/quals given; owner must send details → add to staffWall (suggested Nursery 2).
- CE 2025 score rows for Itofa, Muhammed Kausara, Onimisi were blurry — correct on owner's clearer photo.
- Purge round 2 still unanswered (admin tabs to remove, owner replies numbers).
- BACKLOG: private Supabase, Moniepoint backend, map lat/long (ask owner), tour video, custom domain, TREASURE COLLEGE naming phase, absent-alert automation (backend phase).
- OWNER_IMAGES: upload real staff/group photos → drop into teacher profiles + staff group slot (class-feature.jpg currently a Kogi public-school news photo from kogireports.com).


## Batch 44 additions (launch readiness, owner-directed)
- SEO: every one of the 35 public pages carries unique meta description + canonical + Open Graph + Twitter card + theme-color + manifest/apple-touch links (marker `<!-- treasure-seo -->`); School JSON-LD on index; `robots.txt` (portal + developer disallowed) + `sitemap.xml` (35 URLs, generated per release date); portal pages all `noindex,nofollow`.
- PWA/app-readiness: `site.webmanifest` + icon-192/180/512 (for the future Kotlin/Gradle WebView app — start_url `/index.html`, standalone display).
- `404.html` (branded, noindex, links home/admissions/contact/portal).
- fees.html comparative pricing zone ("Compare fees at a glance", Per term/Per year seg tabs + 5 class bands + "Every fee covers" grid) — spaceship.com-inspired DNA per owner.
- Type scale polish (page-hero clamp headlines, tracking).
- CLEANUP NOTE: the 10 shop-*.jpg demo images LOOK unreferenced but are runtime shop-inventory photos pinned by verify-batch4 — NEVER delete assets/img/shop-*.jpg (restored after accidental deletion).
- Suite loaders now exclude ld+json scripts: `script:not([src]):not([type="application/ld+json"])` globally — preserve when writing new suites.
- 404.html page -> site total = 41 pages; b9/b10 walk pins = 41.


## Batch 46 additions (owner corrections + repo reconciliation)
- Staff Code of Conduct rewritten FAITHFULLY — the paper's 20 numbered rules, plain numbered list, no cards, no categories, "Sign — Management" (owner rejected the earlier categorized-card version).
- tools/tests carries the live suites: verify-batch2.js … verify-batch44.js plus seo.test.js (43 suites, 1422 checks). tools/run-all-tests.sh runs them from the repo root: `npm install jsdom --no-audit --no-fund && bash tools/run-all-tests.sh`.
- Preview→main PR opened as release bundle; merge to main still owner-commanded ("go live").
- Version now `20260919-50` / sw `treasure-v50`.


## Batch 47 additions (owner's typography brief + go-live)
- Type system swap (owner's trio): **Gidole** (real files, body/UI/nav) · **Sabon stack** (headings — loaded libre EB-Garamond-family files named "Garamond Libre", Sabon remains first fallback for licensed owners) · **Northwell stack** (signatures only — loaded libre Kristi files; class .sig). Old Treasure Sans/Serif font files REMOVED (retired deliberately; keep assets/fonts minimal).
- Application map: body/nav/buttons/forms = Gidole · h1/h2/sec-heads/hero/anthem = Garamond stack · .sig only for signatures (CoC "Sign — Management" uses it) · script/script font must NEVER be used for UI.
- PR #1 (preview→main) merged on owner's explicit command = GO LIVE. Main = production from here.


## Batch 48 additions (owner font decision: end of Google-catalog fonts)
- Owner rejected Google-catalog fonts entirely ("all those treasure fonts were replicas of Google fonts"). Type system now **100% Indian Type Foundry (fontshare.com, real designer foundry, free for commercial use, NOT on Google Fonts)**: **Clash Display 500/600** (headings), **General Sans 400/500** (body/UI), **Spline Sans Mono 400** (kickers, `.sec-tag` everywhere, and `.sig` sign-offs). The previous Gidole/Garamond/Kristi files were retired deliberately.
- Human-studio finish: mono kicker labels, `text-wrap:balance` headlines, 70ch measure on section intros, body line-height 1.55, weight discipline (body 400/500, headings 500/600 only).
- `.sig` now renders in mono-italic (studio document style) — not a playful script.
- Files live in assets/fonts/ (5 woff2). Rule holds: any new font must NOT be from Google Fonts or its mirrors; check with the owner before adding type families.


## Batch 49 additions (agent polish & fix pass, 26 Sept 2026 — preview)
Re-applied on top of owner commit 14959de (which had independently bumped sw->v69 / assets 20260926-7-63).
- **Canonical host fixed (long-standing SEO bug):** `tools/set-site-host.py https://treasureacademyageva.vercel.app` rewrote 250 refs across 40 files. Canonical/OG/Twitter/sitemap now point at the live host (HTTP 200) instead of the dead `treasureacademyageva.vercel.app` (404). Owner confirmed staying on ng-psi.vercel.app until a custom domain is bought.
- **Dark mode respects the OS preference:** `autoDark()` checks `prefers-color-scheme: dark` first, then falls back to the 7pm-6am rule. jsdom has no matchMedia so verify-batch16's 10am/10pm pins still hold.
- **Native controls follow the theme:** `color-scheme: dark` for `[data-theme="dark"]`/`[data-theme="dark-hc"]` in glass.css.
- **Version bump v49:** sw `treasure-v70`; assets unified to `20260926-8-64` on public + portal (portal had been left behind at 20260924-61); developer BUILD `treasure-v51`, page-asset label `20260919-51`. verify-batch47 exact-version guard updated to the new strings.
- **All 55 suites green — 12,269 checks** (owner's new verify-batch48 included). No content, DOM, fonts, nav or owner decisions changed.


## Batch 49b additions (critical security + contact fixes, 26 Sept 2026 — preview)
- **SECURITY — demo credentials no longer public.** Removed the `.demo-box` on portal/login.html that advertised Headmistress `HEAD001`/PIN `1234` + parent phones, and removed the "Password Generator" side panel (`genSuggest`) that returned a password suggestion for any pupil from a phone number. The four demo accounts still authenticate (Auth.staffLogin/pupilLogin) and the `fillDemo`/`fillStaff` helpers remain for the test harness, but nothing is shown to the public. verify-batch46 now asserts the credentials are NOT displayed and the generator hole is gone.
- **Phone number corrected.** `+234 814 194 378` (9 digits) -> `+234 814 194 3478` in SCHOOL_DEFAULTS (store.js), the School JSON-LD (seo-build.py) and every regenerated page.
- **tel: links now work without JS.** The 39 empty `href="tel:"` links across all pages now carry `tel:+2348141943478` as a static fallback (site.js still overrides from live data). A parent tapping "Call" gets a valid number even before scripts load.
- All 55 suites green — 12,270 checks.


## Batch 49c additions (homepage news leads with admissions, 26 Sept 2026 — preview)
- **Homepage "latest news" now leads with the fresh Sept 2026 admissions**, not the 2017–2021 graduations. Added seed newsEvents item `NEA26` ("2026/2027 Admissions Are Now Open", dated 2026-09-15, views:0/likes:0) so it sorts to the top of the date-desc feed; the five real graduation records are preserved and follow below. Backfill migration `admNewsV1` pushes NEA26 into existing localStorage saves too.
- Updated the feed assertions in verify-batch47 (six records; admissions leads; newest-5 shown) and verify-batch19 (featured = admissions). All 55 suites green — 12,270 checks.


## Batch 49d (canonical host flipped back to the live URL, 27 Sept 2026 — preview)
- The Vercel project was renamed, which FLIPPED the live URL: `treasureacademyageva.vercel.app` is now live (HTTP 200) and `ng-psi.vercel.app` now 404s — the reverse of the Batch 49 situation. Verified with live HTTP checks before changing anything.
- `tools/set-site-host.py https://treasureacademyageva.vercel.app` rewrote 254 references across 42 files (canonical, og:url/og:image, Twitter, JSON-LD url/logo/image + SearchAction, robots.txt Sitemap:, all sitemap.xml <loc>). Live check now 200, no stragglers in code.
- NOTE: the Batch 49 / 49b notes above describe the earlier (now-superseded) direction and read as contradictory after this flip — kept as history. This 49d entry is the current truth: canonical host = treasureacademyageva.vercel.app.

## Batch 49e (Privacy Policy + Safeguarding pages, 27 Sept 2026 — preview)
- NEW `privacy.html` and `safeguarding.html`, cloned from the standard page template (loader, skip-link, #main, manifest, chatbot + auth scripts) so all strict suites pass.
- Content written in plain, parent-friendly English and accurate to how the school actually runs (data collected at enrolment incl. blood group; localStorage/office storage; birthdays staff-only; bank-transfer fees; WhatsApp 09063932487; Call line +234 814 194 3478). Each page ends with a clearly-marked "For the school to complete before going live" box listing exactly what the owner must send (registered name, CAC/RC no., Ministry approval no., official email, DSL name/contact, review date).
- Wired site-wide: footer now has a Privacy Policy + Safeguarding legal-links row (site.js). DESC entries added to tools/seo-build.py; ran it → canonical/OG/Twitter/breadcrumb generated + both added to sitemap.xml (33 urls).
- Test pins updated for +2 public pages: verify-batch9/10 (41→43 html), verify-batch29 (tel 39→41; added aria-label to in-content tel links so no icon-only control), verify-batch44 (public pages + unique descriptions 35→37). Full suite: 55 suites, 12,270 checks green.
- STILL OPEN (owner-blocked): the placeholder items above must be pasted before these pages go live on main.

## Batch 49f (login demo-code removal, 27 Sept 2026 — preview)
- Removed dead/insecure demo login helpers from portal/login.html: `autoPassTreasure` (bot-check bypass), `demoSubmit`, `fillDemo`, `fillStaff` (one-tap logins with a hardcoded "1234" PIN). Confirmed nothing in the real UI called them — only the test harness did. Real human-verification still uses `passTreasure()`; real login unchanged.
- Reworded the "already logged in" notice from "Trying another demo? Logout first." to neutral "Signing in as someone else? Logout first."
- Updated verify-batch16 (assert helpers are gone + test real pupil phone login instead of the removed one-tap) and verify-batch18 (assert staff phone login resolves to T001 via Auth.staffLogin instead of fillStaff). 55 suites, 12,270 checks green.
- DECISION (kept, not deleted): seed pupils P001–P003 (Adaeze Okafor / Emeka Nwosu / Ada Nwosu — fake demo names, not real PII) were NOT removed. They are the backbone fixture of 17 test suites (auth, results, attendance, rank, testimonials) and the store seed (results L324, attendance L330). Deleting them = a large, risky teardown with little security benefit now that the login UI no longer exposes them. Recommend keeping as the portal demo fixture until the owner supplies real pupils; owner can then replace them.
- Real staff KEPT per owner: HEAD001 (Mrs. Salihu Nanahawa, Headmistress/admin) and T001 (Shaibu Memunat, Primary 1 teacher). NOTE: both still use default PIN "1234" — owner should set real PINs (cannot be invented).

## Batch 49g (real legal data + SEO/security hardening, 27 Sept 2026 — preview)
- Headmistress real phone added to HEAD001 seed: 0813 316 7728 (Mrs. Salihu Nanahawa).
- CAC/legal captured from owner: **Treasure Academy Ageva Limited**, **RC-9634403**, incorporated company, privately held since 2017. Now shown on privacy.html (Who we are), and added to homepage JSON-LD (legalName + identifier RC-9634403 + foundingDate 2017).
- Structured data: removed a DUPLICATE (conflicting-phone) School JSON-LD block on index.html; enriched the single authoritative School block with legalName/RC/foundingDate/sameAs(Facebook). seo.test still finds School as blocks[0].
- Privacy + Safeguarding TODO boxes updated: registered name/RC/founding + DSL (Headmistress, 0813 316 7728) now filled; still-needed = Ministry approval no. + official email (privacy) and local emergency contacts + review date (safeguarding).
- SECURITY/SEO: README.md no longer prints the demo credential table (was publicly indexed on GitHub as the #1 result for the school name and leaked HEAD001/T001/parent phones + PIN 1234). Replaced with a safe note. Tests updated: batch19/46 now assert README does NOT leak creds; batch44 matches the single spaced School block.
- Search findings (web): live vercel site not yet indexed; GitHub repo currently outranks it; NO competing "Treasure Academy" in Ageva/Okene/Kogi. See owner report for Search Console + repo-privacy recommendations.

## Batch 49h (real staff update — Abedoh Rafatu, 27 Sept 2026 — preview)
- Owner: Abedoh Rafatu is now the Primary 4 Class Teacher AND the Nursery 1 Assistant (dual role), replacing Tahab Oyiza Zainab. Phone 0706 492 3346.
- staffWall W05: Tahab Oyiza Zainab → Abedoh Rafatu. gender Female (matches the codebase's existing "Aunty Rafatu" refs), class "Primary 4", position "Class Teacher & Nursery 1 Assistant" (card renders "… - Primary 4"), quals "" (owner to send later), phone stored in record (not rendered publicly), assists:"Nursery 1". About kept in the house "What she does best…" style (required by verify-batch46) and role-based (no invented credentials).
- Nursery 1 head teacher remains Nasirun Yahaya (W04); Abedoh assists there.
- Chatbot now answers "who teaches Primary 4?" → Abedoh Rafatu (data-driven from staffWall).
- Tests updated: verify-batch40 (W05 name pin), verify-batch46 (quals map: Abedoh '' replaces Tahab), verify-ebira (Primary 4 answer). Wall still 11 teachers. 55 suites, 12,270 checks green.
- OPEN: Abedoh's qualification (blank), and whether she should also get a teacher-portal login (T002) — not added yet to avoid weak-PIN proliferation; her phone is on record if needed.

## Batch 49i (homepage news → auto-rotating carousel, 27 Sept 2026 — preview)
- #newsGrid is now a rotating carousel of the latest **4** items (was a static grid of 5). One card shows at a time; the next fades/slides in as the previous fades out. Auto-advances every 5s, pauses on hover, prev/next arrows + clickable dots, and respects prefers-reduced-motion (no auto-advance). Inline <style> so it also works in the single-file preview.
- All latest cards stay in the DOM (visually toggled), so the SEO/structure tests still see them. Lead card = "2026/2027 Admissions Are Now Open".
- Tests updated: verify-batch47 (now expects newest 4, carousel wording), verify-batch46 (news markup asserts ne-carousel). 55 suites, 12,270 checks green.

## Batch 49j (WebP conversion for 3G speed, 27 Sept 2026 — preview)
- New tool tools/webp-build.py: generates .webp siblings (quality 80, method 6) for photographic images >120KB, excluding logo/icon/og-cover/shop/favicon. Ran it → 18 files, 5.7MB → 2.7MB (~3MB / 52% saved).
- Wrapped 16 static <img> tags across 8 pages in <picture><source type="image/webp"> + original <img> fallback (about, homework, index gallery ×9, lost-found, openday, photo-day, reading, uniform). Inner <img> keeps width/height/alt/lazy so seo.test stays green; original PNG/JPG kept as fallback for old browsers.
- JS-data thumbnails (news carousel) still point at PNG originals (lazy, below-fold) — can migrate later if needed.
- No single image >1.2MB; all 55 suites, 12,270 checks green.

## Batch 49l (two real leadership accounts + create-password/OTP-to-developer, 27 Sept 2026 — preview)
CORRECTION of my earlier misread. The only two REAL accounts are the two leadership roles; nobody else gets a login, and the teacher wall stays a display of past/present staff.
- store.js admins: **HEAD001 = Mrs. Salihu Nanahawa (Headmistress, teaches Nursery 1)** and **ASST001 = Mrs. Abedoh Rafatu (Assistant Headmistress, teaches Primary 4)**. Both ship with NO password/PIN (`pin:null, password:null`) + `adminRole` + `title` + `teachesClass`. Migration `staffAccountsV1` upgrades existing saves (drops the old fixed PIN, adds the assistant).
- Auth: `staffLogin("admin",…)` now matches by staff ID OR phone and checks a password the user CREATED; returns `{nopassword:true}` on first login. Added `Auth.staffFind()` and `Auth.setStaffPassword()`. Session carries `adminRole`/`title`/`teachesClass`.
- First-login flow (login.html) reused for staff: pick WhatsApp or SMS → `TAVerify.issue()/issueStaff()` drops the code in the DEVELOPER inbox (no on-screen code anymore) → code verified via `TAVerify.check()` (now also matches staff `idRef`) → `setStaffPassword`.
- verify.js: `issue()` records `method` + `kind:"parent"`; new `issueStaff()` (kind:"staff", idRef, who, phone, method); `queue()` exposes `method`/`kind`/`who`.
- developer.html OTP inbox row now shows **"· send via WhatsApp/SMS"** and marks **staff login** rows.
- Tests updated to the new model (batch8/18/46) + fixed a pre-existing date time-bomb in batch2. Full suite **55 suites / 12,272 checks green**.

STILL TO DO (next): role-gate admin.html so the Assistant Headmistress sees only her agreed sections (headmistress-only: Teachers, Duty Roster, WhatsApp, Testimonials, Website Extras, Shop & Orders, Code of Conduct, Settings); add the "My Class" teacher section on each admin's side (Nursery 1 / Primary 4).

## Batch 49m (leadership role gates + working My Class, 27 Sept 2026 — preview)
- `portal/admin.html` is now role-aware from the authenticated leadership record (not a hardcoded Headmistress dashboard). The top identity and portal label show **Headmistress / Nursery 1** or **Assistant Headmistress / Primary 4**.
- Assistant Headmistress keeps the 17 confirmed sections: Overview, My Class, Staff Messages, Verify Pupils, Registrations, Applications, Pupils, Results, Attendance, Promotions, News/Events, Messages, Entrance Qs, Notices, Class Pages, Calendar, Timetable.
- These exact 8 sections are Headmistress-only and are hidden+disabled for the Assistant, their panels are locked, and the router independently rejects typed hashes/synthetic clicks: Teachers, Duty Roster, WhatsApp, Testimonials, Website Extras, Shop & Orders, Code of Conduct, Settings. The Assistant is not blocked by the Headmistress Code-of-Conduct acceptance modal.
- Added a real **My Class** section for each leadership account's assigned class. It contains: class stats; editable daily attendance with Present/Absent/Late, pupil notifications and parent WhatsApp links; CA1/CA2/Exam result input with grade/average, draft/submission and approved/published locking; class-scoped homework (optional photos); and a class roster with attendance + result status. Every write is scoped to `teachesClass` from the account record.
- Tests now cover the exact Assistant visible-section count and restricted list, route guard, no CoC gate, Primary 4 attendance/result/homework writes tagged to ASST001, and Headmistress's full 25-section/Nursery 1 view. Full suite: **55 suites / 12,283 checks green**.
