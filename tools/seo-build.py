Static SEO pass.

Writes real <meta> into each page at build time rather than injecting from JS,
because crawlers that do not execute scripts must still see the description,
canonical and social card. Run after adding or renaming a page:

    python3 tools/seo-build.py

Also regenerates sitemap.xml so new pages are discoverable.
