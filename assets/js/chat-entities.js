   Treasure Bot - entity understanding
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   The difference between a search box and an assistant is that an assistant
   works out WHAT you are asking about, not just which page mentions your words.

   "my child's cardigan is missing" is not a request for the Lost & Found page.
   It is a lookup: item = cardigan, intent = lost property. The honest answer is
   either "yes, a cardigan is waiting at the office" or "no cardigan has been
   handed in - but these five things have, and here is what to do next".

   Never a dead end. If the specific thing is not there, say so plainly and
   then give the next most useful thing. That is the rule this file exists for.
